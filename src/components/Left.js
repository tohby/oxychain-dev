          Manoa Farm preserves 74,038 ha of forestland in the heart of Northern
          Brazilâ€™s Amazon River Basin. The project region has long been subject
          to natural resource explotation, and Manoa Farm forest has been under
          threat of degradation due to illegal logging. It is one of the few
          private forest areas remaining in the region. Manoa Farm aims to curb
          deforestation by training local stakeholders in forest protection and
          surveillance and supports socio-economic development through
          skilled-labor workshops on non-extractive forest management.

        <h6>Project monitoring Summary</h6>
        <p>
          We note no meaningful disturbance or biomass changes in the project.
          This is a very positive sign for this conservation project that is
          facing intense pressure as it indicates that there has been little
          natural or man-made disturbance (such as illegal logging) of the
          forest. Meanwhile, regional biomass has decreased dramatically as the
          project's surroundings have been almost entirely clear cut in the past
          three years. This activity appears to be increasing.
